INFORMATION
================================================================================
	HPDetector is a free application which specializes in detecting hidden
backdoor TCP/UDP ports.  HPDetector uses a two step process to detect hidden
ports.  First, HPDetector gathers port usage information from either the kernel
or through the 'netstat' utility.  Next, HPDetector attempts to bind to every
port on the system, one at a time.  The reason for binding to every port is that
an exception is thrown when HPDetector attempts to bind to a port that is
already in use.  HPDetector keeps track of the port number it was binding to
whenever a "port in use" exception is thrown.  To determine which ports are
hidden, HPDetector compares the kernel/netstat exported list of ports with the
list gathered from binding exceptions.  If a port caused a binding exception but
is not shown in the kernel/netstat list then it is probably a hidden port.  This
program essentially catches the operating system in a "lie" about which ports
are bound to interface.

OPERATING SYSTEM SPECIFIC INFORMATION
================================================================================
LINUX
	The Linux version of this software is written in JAVA and compiled with
GCJ into a binary executable.  The Linux version relies on the kernel's
exported port data to determine port usage; "/proc/net/tcp" and "/proc/net/udp".
You MUST execute this application with root priviledges or HPDetector will
report ports 1 - 1023 as hidden (by default a non-root application cannot bind
to ports below 1024).  This application relies on the GCJ library available from
"http://gcc.gnu.org/java/".

================================================================================
MISCELLANEOUS
================================================================================
	You should close as many internet and network dependent services as possible
prior to running this application.  If you use networking applications while
HPDetector is probing ports you may get inconsistent reports, showing
non-existant hidden backdoor ports.
	What does it mean if HPDetector reports a hidden port?  This can mean
several things.  First, it can be a sign that your 'netstat' executable or
your kernel has been altered.  Secondly, it can mean that an application
creating a socket after the initial 'netstat' or kernel reading.  These
results should be treated as a warning sign that something deeper may be
compromising your computer; specifically, something at the operating system 
level.
